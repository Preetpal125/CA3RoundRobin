# CA3RoundRobin

## Description

Design a scheduler that can schedule the processes arriving system at periodical intervals. Every process is assigned with a fixed time slice t millisecond. If it is not able to complete its execution within the assigned time quantum, then automated timer generates an interrupt. The scheduler will select the next process in the queue and Dispatcher dispatches the process to processor for execution. Compute the total time for which processes were in the queue waiting for the processor. Take the input for CPU burst, arrival time and time quantum from the user. The Algorithm focuses on Time Sharing. In this algorithm, every process gets executed in a cyclic way. A certain time slice is defined in the system which is called time quantum. Each process present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the execution of the process is completed during that time then the process will terminate else the process will go back to the ready queue and waits for the next turn to complete the execution.


## COMPLEXITY

Complexity of implemented algorithm is O(Î£(bt[i])).
